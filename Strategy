2. ?
3. launch Server OS

1 in detail: 
1.1. find out what device drivers already in linux are necessary for a server to run on (for example) a Raspberry Pi
1.2. find out if node.js can run a kernel written in (mostly) node.js
1.3. find out what system calls this node kernel would need to call to make the drivers do their stuff
1.4. find out whether node.js could support running nginx on top of it or within it or somewhere around it
1.5. find out if this node.js running nginx and with a kernel that can call device drivers would actually work
1.6. if it works, does it work well enough?

Look, to be honest, doesn't need to run node.js. Filling it with a threaded interpretive stack language will do the job just fine.
